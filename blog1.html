        A beneficial effect 3D printing has on society is the ability to change how the medical world does surgeries.
        Many medical surgeries are complicated and long which can risk the patient's life, and many surgeries will have a higher success rate. 
        For example, if a patient needed to replace a heart valve, then the doctor would need to find a replacement that may or may not fit which can become fatal. 
        3D printing allows the doctor to print a heart valve and determine if the fit and function is perfect for the patient. 
        Another great effect 3D printing has on society is that it saves time. Using the previous example, many heart valves are difficult to come by and time consuming to find. 
        Being able to print a heart valve the same day someone comes in with a heart valve problem allows the scheduling of surgery to be faster and more efficient. 
        One harmful effect 3D printing has on society is that it takes away the need of manufacturing jobs from individuals. 
        The more 3D printers are made and more accessible they are to people, the less people need others for their ability to create or manufacture something. 
        Thus, causing the decrease in jobs for people who have only the skill(s) needed to fulfill this jobs leading to many people to make less money and maybe go bankrupt.

        The kind of data the 3D printer uses is the important information needed from the product that would be printed. 
        The 3D printer would read computer-aided design files that contains three-dimensional models. 
        These 3D models tell the printer how to precisely place the layers of the material in a way that would transform a product design into a physical product. 
        For example, if someone wanted to print a figurine of a cat, or anything else, then the printer would read CAD files that contains 3D models on figurines of cats. 
        This would tell the printer how to exactly place the layers of the material the printer is using that would make the end product of a figurine of a cat. 
        In other words, the input would be the CAD files that give 3D models, transforms this data into a physical product, and the end product is the 3D model that is printed. 
        One security concern on 3D printers is cyber attacks. Many critical infrastructures use 3D printers to print important objects and parts. 
        If someone were to hack into the printers and cease all functions, then many of these infrastructures, such as hospitals, NASA, etc, would be in jeopardy of many catastrophes.
