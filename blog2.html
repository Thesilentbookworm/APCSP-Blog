        The computing innovation I chose is Twitter which revolutionized how people
        are exposed to information about current political, economical, and other 
        situations. Twitter is designed to provide a space for many to be kept in the 
        sphere to update current events and trends
        through tweets. The function of Twitter happens when a client types in the text 
        box where they would then request to send and post their tweet on the website 
        under their profile for many to see. My artifact provides an illustration of 
        Twitter's function which allows their users the ability to be in the know.

        In order to create my artifact of Twitter, which is a new artifact seeing as I created 
        it from scratch, I used the website called Canva, <a href = "https://www.canva.com/?_sm_byp=iVVHsq7kF0q26np3">www.canva.com</a>. This website allowed 
        me to gather relevant images by uploading them from online, making a flowchart. Furthermore, 
        I was provided 
        a template in which I edited in order for the template to suit my needs by sorting the uploaded 
        images to follow a sequence in how Twitter functions, providing minimal captions to explain 
        the images, and a title of "Twitter".

          A beneficial effect Twitter has is the ability to provide a service where 
          political leaders and organizations are able to keep others in the know. 
          According to the company's CMO, Leslie 
          Berland, Twitter mainly focuses on providing the ability for their users to tweet
          blurbs about information that woukd be exposed to others keeping them in the loop,
          which has a more effect on the younger generation than regular news stations 
          do. For example, if a political organization or movement, such as the #MeToo 
          movement, wanted more exposure and notice of the public, then they would go
          on Twitter and provide a tweet while referencing their 
          organization with a '#___', thus allowing many to notice these political
          events, movements, organizations, etc. and being able to find more current information
          through Twitter.
          
          <br></br>

          One harmful effect Twitter has is how it is used. Many users of Twitter post
          abhorrent tweets that are aimed at others, and is often used to bad-mouth different people. 
          For example, our current U.S President, 
          Donald J. Trump, uses Twitter to publish discriminating tweets targeted toward other 
          ethnicites and races in order to incite his fanbase and supporters. According to an 
          article on CNN, it was said that Trump had tweeted how he refers to Elizabeth Warren, 
          a Native American presedential candidate, as Pocahontas and he'd see her on the 'TRAIL' 
          referring to the Trail of Tears. As such, Twitter can be used to negatively influence 
          others in doing the same thing, whilst attacking others.

        The kind of data Twitter uses is the important information needed for the tweet to be 'tweeted'
        on a user's or Twitter's home page. Twitter would read the user's information required to know
        who tweeted what, when they tweeted it, and if they met the maximum set for characters. These types
        of information tell Twitter's servers exactly what to display on the home page of the user. For example,
        if someone tweeted 'This is my first TWEET!!', then the server would be able to send the information
        back with the data of: the user's display name and user ID, their photo, and time stamp. This would
        tell the other users who viewed this tweet who posted the tweet, when they posted it, and what their
        profile picture is. In other words, the input would be the information that is necessary for an individual
        to post a tweet, leading for the end result of the tweet, time stamp, display name, and any tagged
        information to be displayed.
        
        <br></br>
        
        One concern on Twitter is data security that can eventually lead to financial risks. Many users provide
        their personal information, such as their current address, passwords, etc., on their profiles which can
        be accessed by anyone who follows them even if the user's profile is private. If someone were to gain
        access to their private information, then they would be able to expose this security breach and use this
        chance to further gain access to the user's other accounts, such as their banking accounts.
